## Introduction
This is a simple text game I made in order to solve the first task in the "Programming in C#" course at Jagiellonian University.

## Gameplay
The user is prompted to provide their hero name and hero class. The user is later taken into a location with NPCs present. The user can choose an NPC to talk to, initiating a dialogue with that character. The NPC's responses are chosen randomly, while the hero's responses are selected by the user.

## Features
- Highly scalable for adding new locations.
- Support for adding new NPCs.
- Expandable dialogue options for both the hero and NPCs.
